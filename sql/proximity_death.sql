/* PROXIMITY TO DEATH AND LUNNEY GROUPS

Notes:
1. Fixed: Zero months is less likely than one month as we're using the name of the month of death, rather than the 30 days to death. Eg. Death could occur on the 3rd of the month making multiple admissions in that "zero" month unlikely.
2. This script differs from others by the fact that it includes deaths that occur in the following year. This seems logical to me.
3. Ask about random assigment of 'frailty' to Lunney Group.
4. Population here is unhelpful.
